# A random Maze Generator + mini game

## Description

The code renders a grid with n columns and rows and uses an algorithm called Recursive Backtracking to randomly generate a maze.
There is a bonus mini game after the maze generation is completed, where you can use the arrow keys to move a blue circle to its destination in yellow.
This was made using p5.js
